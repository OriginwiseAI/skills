## Notes

- This repository is the canonical source for public skill content.
- The public site mirror at `https://kpainter.ai/skill.md` should be synced from `skills/kpainter/SKILL.md`, not edited separately.
- The current public OpenClaw / ClawHub slug is `kpainter`.
- Public metadata should stay English-first for broad marketplace compatibility.
- The skill supports the user's preferred language. Multilingual examples are examples, not a language allowlist.
